Duration: 00h15
	Drew out rough plans for the class structures on a white board.
	Agreed to all read through each other's individual designs and decide on the best way forward in the next meeting.

Wednesday, 04 April 2018
Duration: 01h12
	Elements from each member's design were used.
	Overall design includes classes for the following:
		-File: class 
		-FileManager: class for managing the different file objects created
		-Graph: object for storing the data for plottingt he graph
		-Graph Manager: 
		-Graph Renderer: main class for handling the plotting of graphs
		-Individual: class for managing the general indiv
	Planned to all read up on how to use Pyforms and start experimenting with it. Kenan agreed to set up the file structure and github page.

Duration: 00h15
	Discussed written up meeting minutes and further discussed class structure. It was decided to use inheritance i.e. Individual is the generalised class whilst PcaIndividual and AdmixIndividual are the derived classes. Derived classes would also be created for the Graph class.
	Kenan 
	Pyforms usability discussed.
	Git repository is set up and functional.
	Kenan - to work on File and FileManager
	Aimee - to work on the FileImporter
	Dhevan - to work on Individual classes

Duration: 01h03
	Kenan started working on the GraphManager class.
	Discussed class structure. It was decided that the GraphManger is the "head" of all communication. 
	Discussed the introduction of classes.
	PcaAppearance class and admixTure appearance class needed for storing the appearance options. 
	PcaCreator and AdmixCreator classes needed as controllers for receiving user input (importing files, selecting columns etc.) and analysing this input to retrieve the data necessary for plotting the graph.
	Kenan - embedding matplotlib form into the pyforms frame and GraphManager class.
	Aimee - pcaCreator class and integration with file importer.
	Dhevan - admixCreator class and integration with fileImporter.

Duration: 00h45
	Having difficulties trying to embed the matplotlib form into the pyforms frame. May need to consider changing to wxPython.
	Issues with cyclic importing between the pcaCreator and fileImporter.


Monday, 30 April 2018
Duration: 00h33
	Cyclic importing issue was fixed by removing the fileImporter GUI and passing in the necessary parameters when calling the function in the class.
	Pyforms code has been removed. Now using wxPython.
	After researching, it was found to be much easier.
	Making progress with embedding the matplotlib form in the wxPython frame.
	wxBuilder being used to generate the GUI code - allows for greater seperation of the Model and the View.
	Unit testing was discussed


Monday, 07 May 2018
Duration: 00h41
	Dhevan has started the unit testing.
	The order of importance of functionality was discussed and decided upon.
	It was decided that the graphRenderer class was redundant. 
	Kenan - finish embedding matplotlib form in wxPython frame and polish graph Manager
	Aimee - loading and saving for PCA, pcaGraph and pcaAppearance
	Dhevan - loading and saving for Admix, admixGraph and admixAppearance
	No time to implement annotations, line drawing, individual selection and searching or any other graph interactivity.
